I want to create an app that finds the users' learning profile according to the selection that s/he made. I have many courses which have also the description and images. Such as :

Course Name : Description : Image Path 
"""
"Cömert Dinleme" : "Cömert dinleme kursu ......... anlatan bir kurstur" : "./path/to/comert_dinleme.jpg"
"Zaman yönetimi" : "Bu kursta zamanın şu yöntemlerle  ......... nasıl etkili kullanılabileceği anlatılmaktadır." : "./path/to/zaman_yonetimi.jpg"
.
.
.

"""

In the main screen there will be a page that describes our web-app briefly and the "Start" button. When user press the start the "course tournement" page will appear. This page is divided into two: 
-- The left part includes the general visualization of the tournement, where only the small images of the courses are shown in the tournement tree.
-- The right part of the page is where user will make selections for each match in the tournement one by one. There will be 16 courses so user will select 8 courses on 1st round, then the selected 8 courses will be matched again and user will select 4 courses in 2nd round, 2 courses in 3rd round and 1 course on final to find the winner. The selection page should include 2 courses for each match, where the courses' image and title are shown.

Here is the design.json that may be helpful for this page. It should not have to be implemented exactly, we can change it, it is not strict.

After all selections are completed, new page should be loaded. 
-- There should be shown a tierlist at the left side of the screen, where the winner is at the top, 2nd is at the second place etc. This list should be edited with the drag-drop mechanism , user should be able to arrange the order after all selections completed.
-- Now the right side of the screen should have button named "Find my profile". The functionality of the button will be handled later, so you can put a dummy button there.

Now I want you to understand the application that I described and ask me any question that you want. After I am convinced that you understand the requirements, we will start to implement step by step.


Mapped out tournament app with detailed design and flow.


I understand the core concept of your learning profile discovery app! It's a tournament-style course selection system that helps users identify their preferences through head-to-head comparisons. Let me ask a few clarifying questions to make sure I have all the details right:

Tournament Mechanics:
Initial course pairing: How should the 16 courses be initially paired for Round 1? Random pairing, or do you have a specific seeding strategy?
Tournament bracket display: In the left panel, should the bracket show:
Just course images/thumbnails in each position?
Course names as well?
Should it update in real-time as users make selections?
Data & Course Information:
Course data: Do you have the actual 16 courses ready, or should I create some sample courses for development? If you have them, could you share a few examples?
Course descriptions: In the voting area, should we show just the course name and image, or also include the description text?
Results & Tier List:
Tier list structure: After the tournament, should the tier list show:
All 16 courses ranked 1-16?
Or grouped into tiers (like S, A, B, C tiers)?
How should the initial ranking be determined (based on how far they progressed in the tournament)?
Drag-drop editing: Should users be able to rearrange individual courses, or move entire tiers?
Technical Preferences:
Implementation: Would you prefer this as a React component, HTML/CSS/JS, or do you have a preference?
Responsive design: The design.json suggests landscape orientation - should this work on mobile devices too, or is it primarily for desktop/tablet?
Once I understand these details, I'll be ready to start building this step by step!

1 -- random pairing
2 -- just the images of the courses, no names. It should be updated in real-time such that after selection the box around the selected course can be green.
3 -- You can create some dummy course names and descriptions for development. I do not have now, they can be very short.
4 -- only name and the image should be shown.
5 -- they should be grouped inte S,A,B,C tiers. For example in S tier only the 1st course should be shown. A tier 2nd course, B tier 3rd and 4th. C tier 5,6,7,8'th courses should be shown.
6 -- Users should be able to rearrange individual courses.
7 -- I will use React.
8 -- It will be for desktop primarily.
Do you have any more questions ? If you have you should ask now. If you do not make a plan to implement it first. Do not implement anything yet.


Strategized tournament design and implementation details for React app


Perfect! I have a clear picture now. Just a couple of final clarifications:

Final Questions:
Navigation between rounds: After a user completes all matches in Round 1, should they automatically proceed to Round 2, or should there be a "Next Round" button they need to click?
Tournament bracket layout: Should the bracket be displayed horizontally (Round 1 → Round 2 → Round 3 → Final from left to right) or vertically? Given the left panel space, horizontal seems more practical.
Course selection feedback: When a user clicks on a course in the voting area, should there be immediate visual feedback (like highlighting) before moving to the next match?
Tier list initialization: After the tournament, should the tier list be pre-populated based on tournament results, or start empty for users to fill?
Implementation Plan:
Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Structure
Create React app with necessary state management
Define course data structure and create 16 dummy courses
Set up tournament bracket logic (pairing, progression tracking)
Phase 2: Main Landing Page
Simple welcome page with app description
"Start" button leading to tournament
Phase 3: Tournament Page - Basic Layout
Two-panel layout (40% left bracket, 60% right voting)
Header with round information
Progress bar at bottom
Phase 4: Tournament Bracket (Left Panel)
Tournament tree visualization
Course image thumbnails in bracket positions
Real-time updates with green borders for winners
Phase 5: Voting Area (Right Panel)
Course card components with images and names
VS separator
Click handling for course selection
Round progression logic
Phase 6: Results Page - Tier List
S/A/B/C tier structure
Drag-and-drop functionality for rearranging courses
"Find my profile" placeholder button
Phase 7: Polish & Transitions
Smooth animations between rounds
Visual enhancements and responsive adjustments
Does this plan look good to you? Any adjustments needed before we start implementation?

1 -- Automatically proceed to next round
2 -- It should be horizontal
3 -- It should be highlightined
4 -- Tier list should be pre-populated, it is the whole point of the selection/tournement proecess

Okay. Now lets implement the Phase-1 ""Project Setup & Data Structure"" . Guide me step by step. Tell me what to do one by one.


Mapped out React project setup for tournament bracket implementation.


Perfect! Let's implement Phase 1 step by step. I'll guide you through each step.

Step 1: Create the React App Structure
First, let's set up the basic file structure. Create these files in your React project:

src/
  components/
    LandingPage.jsx
    TournamentPage.jsx
    ResultsPage.jsx
  data/
    courses.js
  utils/
    tournamentLogic.js
  App.jsx
  App.css
Action for you: Create these folders and empty files first. Don't write any code yet.

Step 2: Define Course Data Structure
Let's create the course data. In src/data/courses.js, we'll define our 16 dummy courses.

Action for you: Tell me when you've created the file structure above, and I'll give you the exact code for the courses data.

Step 3: Set Up Tournament Logic
We'll need functions to:

Create random pairings for Round 1
Track tournament progression
Manage round transitions
Action for you: Let me know when Step 1 is complete, and we'll move to Step 2 with the actual code.

Are you ready to create the file structure? Let me know when you've created all the folders and empty files, then we'll start adding the code!

Yes, I completed step - 1. Lets move on to step 2


Plotted course data structure for learning profile app.



Great! Now let's add the course data structure.

Step 2: Create Course Data
Action: Copy this code into src/data/courses.js:

courses.js - Course Data Structure
Code 

Plotted course progression and sought user confirmation.

Action for you: Copy this code into your src/data/courses.js file.

This creates:

16 learning courses with Turkish names (as per your example)
Each course has: id, name, description, and image path
Helper functions to retrieve courses by ID
Step 3: Create Tournament Logic
Now let's create the tournament logic functions.

Action: Tell me when you've added the courses data, and I'll give you the code for src/utils/tournamentLogic.js which will handle:

Random pairing for Round 1
Tournament bracket structure
Round progression logic
Winner tracking
Ready for the tournament logic code?

Yes, lets move on to the step-3

Random pairing: shuffleArray and createInitialBracket for Round 1
Match progression: advanceWinner automatically creates next round when current round completes
Tournament tracking: Tracks current match, round completion, and winners
Final ranking: Generates 1st-16th place ranking based on elimination order
Tier list generation: Converts ranking to S/A/B/C tiers (S=1st, A=2nd, B=3rd&4th, C=5th-8th)
Step 4: Set Up Main App State Management
Now we need to set up the main App component with state management to tie everything together.

Action: Tell me when you've added the tournament logic code, and I'll give you the main App.jsx setup that will:

Manage tournament state
Handle page navigation (Landing → Tournament → Results)
Initialize the tournament bracket
Pass data between components
Ready for the App component setup?

okay, lets continue with step-4


Architected comprehensive app state management strategy for tournament.



Great! Now let's set up the main App component with state management.

Clickable course cards
Hover animations (cards lift up, images scale)
Automatic progression through tournament
Responsive design for different screen sizes
Test Your Tournament Page:
Action:

Run your React app
Click "Başla" from landing page
You should see the tournament page with:
Two course cards you can click
Progress bar showing completion percentage
Round information in header
Placeholder text for bracket area
The tournament logic should work - clicking a course should advance to the next match automatically!

Ready for Phase 4?
Next up is Phase 4: Tournament Bracket (Left Panel). This will create the actual bracket visualization with:

Tournament tree structure
Course thumbnails in bracket positions
Real-time updates with green borders for winners
Horizontal layout from Round 1 → Final
Are you ready to continue with Phase 4, or do you want to test the current tournament functionality first?

Okay, lets continue with the Phase 4. 

The bracket should be connected with the lines. The 8 course should be at the left and 8 at the right which are grouped 2 course in each node. So there will be 4 node in left and 4 node in right initally. After selecting, selected course should be copied to the next round, inner. So the final match will be at the middle of the left panel. I want to be sure that you understand me well. You can ask me any questions before implementing.


Mapped out tournament bracket layout with precise progression.

Perfect! I want to make sure I understand the bracket layout correctly before implementing. Let me clarify:

Bracket Layout Understanding:
Visual Structure (horizontal layout):

Round 1        Round 2      Round 3       Final        Round 3      Round 2        Round 1
[Course1]                                                                            [Course9]
[Course2] ---> [Winner1]                                                [Winner5] <--- [Course10]
                    \                                                   /
                     --> [Semi1] -----> [FINAL] <----- [Semi2] <--
                    /                                                   \
[Course3] ---> [Winner2]                                                [Winner6] <--- [Course11]
[Course4]                                                                            [Course12]

[Course5]                                                                            [Course13]
[Course6] ---> [Winner3]                                                [Winner7] <--- [Course14]
                    \                                                   /
                     --> [Semi3] -----> [FINAL] <----- [Semi4] <--
                    /                                                   \
[Course7] ---> [Winner4]                                                [Winner8] <--- [Course15]
[Course8]                                                                            [Course16]
Questions to Confirm:
Initial Display: Should I show all 16 courses as small thumbnails/images in their Round 1 positions from the start?
Node Content: Each "node" should contain:
Course thumbnail/image?
Course name?
Or just a placeholder box until a winner is determined?
Winner Highlighting: When a course wins, should:
The winning course get a green border in its current position?
The winner immediately appear in the next round node?
Both?
Lines/Connections: Should the connecting lines be:
Always visible (showing the bracket structure)?
Or only appear as matches are completed?
Node Sizes: Should all nodes be the same size, or should they get progressively larger toward the final?
Current Match Indicator: Should there be visual indication of which match is currently being voted on in the right panel?
Once I understand these details, I can implement the exact bracket visualization you want!

1 -- All the images should be visible initally. I dont want to put "Round 1" "Round 2" etc. to the left panel.
2 -- Each node consist of 2 courses and each course consist of the image of the course only, no name - no description.
3 -- Yes, it should get green border and the winner immadiatelty appear in the next round node
4 -- Always visible
5 -- same size
6 -- It would be great if there is a current match indicator.

Since I made some little changes on the code that you provided I do not want you to give me the whole code. Just give me the parts that need to added or replaced. I will add them manually.


Strategized bracket visualization with specific course image requirements.




Perfect! I understand exactly what you want. Let me give you the specific parts to add/replace:

1. Replace the bracket-placeholder section in TournamentPage.jsx
Replace this section:

jsx
<div className="bracket-placeholder">
  {/* Bracket visualization will be implemented in Phase 4 */}
  <p>Bracket visualization coming soon...</p>
  <div className="bracket-info">
    <p>Current Round: {bracket?.currentRound || 1}</p>
    <p>Total Rounds: {bracket?.totalRounds || 4}</p>
  </div>
</div>
With this:

Bracket JSX Replacement
Code 

Strategized CSS implementation for tournament bracket visualization.

2. Add this CSS to TournamentPage.css
Add this at the end of your TournamentPage.css file:

Bracket CSS Addition
Code 

Refined function logic for match winner determination.

3. Fix the getMatchWinner helper function
Replace the getMatchWinner function in the JSX with this corrected version:

Fixed Helper Functions
Code 

Refined tournament bracket rendering logic for accurate advancement.

4. Update the Round 2 and Round 3 sections
Replace the Round 2 Left, Round 2 Right, Round 3 Left, and Round 3 Right sections with:

Corrected Round 2 and Round 3 Sections
Code 

Strategized updating and removing placeholder content structure.

5. Remove/Update the bracket-content wrapper
In your existing bracket-content div, remove the bracket-title and update it to just contain the tournament-bracket:

Replace:

jsx
<div className="bracket-content">
  <h3 className="bracket-title">Tournament Bracket</h3>
  {/* your new tournament-bracket div goes here */}
</div>
With:

jsx
<div className="bracket-content">
  {/* your new tournament-bracket div goes here */}
</div>
That's it! These changes will give you:

✅ All 16 courses visible initially in Round 1 positions
✅ Course images only (no names) in small nodes
✅ Green borders for winners with glow animation
✅ Red pulsing borders for current match courses
✅ Connecting lines always visible
✅ Winners automatically appear in next round positions
✅ Final match in the center with larger node

The bracket will automatically update as you click through the tournament!

Okay nice. Lets continue with the tierlist. After last question, it shoulda utomatically switch into the tierlist page. The results page is different than the tierlist page so I created tierlist page named TierlistPage.jsx and add it into tha App.jsx. I want to be sure that you understand the tierlist page well based on our previous discussion so tell me. No implementation yet.


Decoded tierlist page requirements and confirmed understanding.



Perfect! Let me confirm my understanding of the TierlistPage based on our previous discussion:

TierlistPage Layout & Functionality:
Left Side - Tier List (Main Area):
S Tier: Contains only the 1st place course (tournament winner)
A Tier: Contains only the 2nd place course (tournament runner-up)
B Tier: Contains 3rd and 4th place courses (semi-final losers)
C Tier: Contains 5th-8th place courses (quarter-final losers)
Right Side - Profile Section:
"Find my profile" button (dummy functionality for now)
Possibly some descriptive text about the profile analysis
Key Features:
Pre-populated: Tierlist automatically filled based on tournament elimination order
Drag & Drop: Users can rearrange individual courses between and within tiers
Visual Design: Each tier should be clearly labeled (S, A, B, C) and visually distinct
Course Display: Each course shows image and name (similar to tournament cards but smaller)
Data Flow:
Receives finalRanking array from tournament results
Initial tierlist generated using generateTierList() function we created
Updates tierlist state when user drags/drops courses
Sends updated tierlist back to App.jsx via onUpdateTierList callback
Auto-Navigation:
Automatically loads when isTournamentComplete() returns true
No manual navigation needed
Questions to Confirm:
Tier Styling: Should each tier have different background colors or just different labels?
Course Cards: Should they be smaller versions of tournament cards, or a different design entirely?
Drag Feedback: Should there be visual indicators showing valid drop zones while dragging?
Reset Option: Should there be a way to reset the tierlist back to the original tournament results?
Tier Constraints: Can users move courses to any tier, or should there be validation (e.g., S tier can only hold 1 course)?
Does this match your vision? Any corrections or additional details I should know?

1 - different colors
2 - course cards should include only the name of the course
3 - yes 
4 - yes 
5 - users can move courses to any tier without any constraints
We should not divide the page into two parts. The tierlist should be at the top and the "Find My Profile" button should be located at the bottom of the page.


Mapped out tierlist page design with flexible course placement.


Perfect! I understand the TierlistPage layout now:

TierlistPage Layout & Functionality:
Page Layout:
Top Section (Main Area): Full-width tier list spanning the entire page width
Bottom Section: "Find my profile" button centered at the bottom of the page
Tier List Details:
S Tier: Distinct background color, initially contains 1st place course
A Tier: Different background color, initially contains 2nd place course
B Tier: Different background color, initially contains 3rd and 4th place courses
C Tier: Different background color, initially contains 5th-8th place courses
Each tier clearly labeled and visually distinct
Course Cards:
Text-only: Display course name only (no images)
Smaller design than tournament cards
Draggable for rearranging
Key Features:
Pre-populated from tournament elimination results
Drag & Drop individual courses between/within any tiers
Visual drop zone indicators while dragging
Reset functionality to restore original tournament results
No constraints - users can put unlimited courses in any tier
Find my profile button centered at bottom
Data Flow:
Receives tierList object: { S: [course], A: [course], B: [course1, course2], C: [course1, course2, course3, course4] }
Updates via onUpdateTierList(newTierList) callback
onFindProfile() for button click
Possible onReset() to restore original results
Props Expected:
javascript
<TierlistPage 
  tierList={tierList}
  onUpdateTierList={updateTierList}
  onFindProfile={findProfile}
  onReset={resetToOriginal} // if we add this
/>
Does this capture your vision correctly? Should I proceed with implementation using this understanding?

yes. Since I made some little changes on the code that you provided I do not want you to give me the whole code. Just give me the parts that need to added or replaced. I will add them manually.


Strategized comprehensive plan for TierlistPage implementation details.



Perfect! Here are the specific parts you need to add:

1. Create TierlistPage.jsx - Main Component Structure
Create src/components/TierlistPage.jsx with this content:

TierlistPage.jsx - Main Component
Code 

Plotted comprehensive CSS styling strategy for tierlist page.


2. Create TierlistPage.css - Component Styles
Create src/components/TierlistPage.css with this content:

TierlistPage.css - Component Styles
Code 

Mapped out App.jsx modifications for TierlistPage integration.


3. Update App.jsx - Add TierlistPage Integration
Add this import at the top of your App.jsx:

App.jsx Import Addition
Code 

Mapped out React component navigation and state updates.


Update the currentPage state options (if needed):

App.jsx State Update
Code 

Pondered function updates for course selection and rendering.

Replace your selectCourse function with this updated version:

Updated selectCourse Function
Code 

Pondered implementation strategy for renderCurrentPage function.

Add this case to your renderCurrentPage function switch statement:

TierlistPage Case Addition
Code 

Pondered updating resetApp function for new state.

Update your resetApp function to handle the new state:

Updated resetApp Function
Code 

Pondered removing 'results' case from renderCurrentPage function.

Remove the 'results' case from your renderCurrentPage function if it exists, since we're using 'tierlist' instead.

4. Remove ResultsPage Import (if you have it)
Remove this line from your imports if it exists:

javascript
import ResultsPage from './components/ResultsPage';
That's it! These changes will give you:

✅ Full-width tierlist at the top with S/A/B/C tiers in different colors
✅ Course cards with names only (no images)
✅ Drag & drop functionality with visual feedback
✅ Drop zone indicators when dragging
✅ Reset functionality to restore original tournament results
✅ No tier constraints - unlimited courses per tier
✅ Three buttons at bottom: Reset, Find Profile, Restart
✅ Automatic navigation from tournament completion to tierlist

The tierlist will automatically populate with your tournament results and allow full drag-and-drop customization!

I want to change the colors. The following pallete is my reference, I want to use the similar colors in my app :
